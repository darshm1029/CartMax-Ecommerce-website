### CartMax is a online platform where a user can purchase or sell items available on the market.

Here the user first needs to login in the website if a new user he need to get himself registered. 

If a Username/Email_address is already registered then the application shows an error that it already exits.

After registering themselves on the website the user lands on the market pages where he can buy and sell items available on the market. 

There is a wallet available from which the money gets deducted everytime a purchase is made and vice-versa for selling the item.

The user can logout/login any number of times.
